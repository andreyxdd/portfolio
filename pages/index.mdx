# Andrei Volkov

Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio

I'm a self-disciplined, open-minded, and versatile software developer with 4+ years of hands-on experience: from building cross-platform apps to implementing numerical methods.

- coding for 10+ years - it's my passion
- at the moment, learning more about DevOps/MLOps on the side
- if I weren't a developer, I would be a doctor
- curious language learner: spanish and german
- meditation and stretching keep me sane
